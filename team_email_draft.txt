Subject: Starting Google Cloud Digital Leadership Certification Journey - Weekly Tech Newsletters

Hi Team,

I wanted to share some exciting news with you all. I've embarked on a Google Cloud Digital Leadership certification journey to deepen my understanding of cloud technologies and digital transformation strategies.

As part of this learning experience and to hold myself accountable, I'll be posting tech newsletters on my website on a weekly basis, documenting key insights and learnings from the certification program. This will help me reinforce the concepts while potentially providing valuable information for anyone interested in cloud leadership topics.

I'll send out a brief email notification whenever I add new topics to the site, so you can stay updated on the latest content if you're interested.

I want to extend my sincere thanks to Maduri and Tom for allowing me to pursue this professional development opportunity and share my learnings in this format.

Looking forward to sharing insights from this certification journey with the team on a regular basis!

Best regards,
Rahul
