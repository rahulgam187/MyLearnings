# Deployment Guide for MyTechLetter Website

## For Network Drive/File Sharing Setup

### Step 1: Prepare the Files
Essential files needed for the website:
- `index.html` (main entry point)
- `tech_letter.html` (content page)  
- `about.html` (about page)
- `style.css` (styling)
- `script.js` (functionality)
- `shared_responsibility_model.png` (image)
- `README.md` (user instructions)
- `OPEN_WEBSITE.bat` (easy access shortcut)

### Step 2: Choose Your Sharing Method

#### Option A: Network Drive
1. Copy all website files to a shared network drive
2. Create a folder like `\\server\shared\MyTechLetter\`
3. Ensure all team members have read access
4. Share the path with colleagues

#### Option B: OneDrive/SharePoint Document Library
1. Upload all files to a shared OneDrive folder
2. Share the folder with your team
3. Colleagues can download and run locally

2. Email to colleagues with instructions
3. They extract and run locally

### Step 3: Instructions for Colleagues

**Easy Method:**
"Double-click on OPEN_WEBSITE.bat"

**Manual Method:**
"Double-click on index.html to open in your browser"

### Step 4: Accessing from Network Drive
When files are on a network drive, colleagues can:
