                <h2>Value of Data</h2>
                <p>Data is an essential ingredient for driving innovation and differentiation, and is the key to unlocking value from artificial intelligence. It powers AI-driven business insights, helps in real-time decision making and is basis of how organizations build their apps.</p>
                
                <p>Organizations are not only focusing on sales, inventory or personnel data, but are also keen in extracting value from hidden data points from a myriad of sources and systems like how customers engage with you across social media platforms.</p>
                
                <p>Capturing and storing such data can be complex.</p>
                
                <p>Organizations that want to adapt must determine how to close the gap and support value generation. An intelligent data cloud is key to unlocking more business value.</p>

                <h2>Data Model Categorizations</h2>
                <ul class="structured-list">
                    <li><strong>Structured:</strong> Highly organized and well defined. E.g.: Data in CRM's, BPM's etc.</li>
                    <li><strong>Semi-structured:</strong> Organized into a hierarchy but without differentiation or any particular ordering. E.g.: HTML, JSON, XML, emails etc.</li>
                    <li><strong>Unstructured:</strong> Either don't have predefined data model or isn't organized in a predefined manner. E.g.: videos, social media posts, data files (documents, presentations), images, audio files etc.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>With right tools businesses can extract value from unstructured data by using machine learning. Google's Cloud Vision API can help in identifying and even label the pictures to describe the contents.</p>

                <h3>Data Warehouses</h3>
                <p>A place to store data, unlike databases which are used to store, retrieve and use data, data warehouses are used for analysis and reporting of structured and semi-structured data from multiple sources. Data present anywhere in the organization can be stored here for analysis and reporting (like a central hub for all business data) - reporting can be ad hoc or custom.</p>
                <p><strong>Google's data warehousing solution is BigQuery</strong></p>

                <h3>Data Lakes</h3>
                <p>A repository to ingest, store, explore, process and analyze any type of volumes of raw data, regardless of source. It can store different types of data in its original format; ignoring size limits, and without much pre-processing or adding structure.</p>
                
                <p>This differs from a data warehouse that contains structured data that has been cleaned and processed, ready for strategic analysis based on predefined business needs.</p>
                
                <p>Data lakes consists of several products depending on the type of data being ingested:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>For structured data: Cloud SQL, Spanner or BigQuery</li>
                    <li>For semi-structured options: Bigtable and Datastore</li>
                    <li>For unstructured data: Cloud Storage</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p><strong>Key Difference:</strong> Data warehouse users are business intelligence analysts who are closer to business, data lake users are data scientists and data engineers who are close to raw data.</p>

                <h2>Data Categorizations</h2>
                <ul class="structured-list">
                    <li><strong>First party data:</strong> Proprietary customer datasets that a business collects from customer or audience transactions and interactions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Second party data:</strong> First-party data from another organization, such as a partner or other business in their supply chain, that can be easily deployed to augment a company's internal datasets. Organizations don't directly own this data but is relevant to their business.</li>
                    <li><strong>Third party data:</strong> Datasets collected and managed by organizations that don't directly interact with an organization's customers or business. These datasets might come from government, nonprofit, or academic sources, like weather or public demographic data, or from industry-specific sources like analyst reports or industry benchmarking.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Google's marketplace</strong> is a platform to purchase third party data.</p>
                <p>No matter where you are in your company, you too can use data to solve challenges.</p>

                <h4>Dataflow</h4>
                <p>Creates a pipeline to process both streaming (real-time) and batch data. Unifies streaming and batch data analysis and builds cohesive data pipelines.</p>

                <p><strong>Process refers to the steps:</strong> Extract, Transform and Load data referred to as ETL.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Popular solution for pipeline design is Apache Beam:</strong> An open source, unified programming model to define and execute data processing pipelines including ETL, batch and stream processing.</p>
                
                <p>Dataflow allows reliable auto scaling to meet pipeline demands. It is serverless (computing means that a software developer can build and run apps without having to provision or manage backend infrastructure) and fully managed. Google Cloud manages infrastructure tasks on behalf of users like resource provisioning, performance tuning and ensuring pipeline reliability.</p>
